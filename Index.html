        <!-- Introduction to Usain Bolt and his achievements -->
        Usain Bolt, born in Sherwood Content Aug 21 1986, Jamaica, is regarded by many as the greatest sprinter in history. 
        He set his first world record on May 31, 2008, during the Jamaica Trials in Kingston, where he recorded an incredible 
        time of 9.72 seconds in the 100 meters. 
        This remarkable speed not only dethroned the previous world record of <del>9.77</del> seconds held by Asafa Powell but also 
        established Bolt as the first man since American Carl Lewis in 1984 to win the 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4 Ã— 100-meter 
        relay in a single Olympics. He was also the first ever to set world records in all three events (9.69 seconds, 19.30 seconds, 
        and 37.10 seconds, respectively). His explosive speed and charming personality won fans around the world, making him a 
        global sports icon. Over the years, he would go on to break his own records.<br>
